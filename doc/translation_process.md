Translations
============

The Suppo Core project has been designed to support multiple localisations. This makes adding new phrases, and completely new languages easily achievable. For managing all application translations, Suppo Core makes use of the Transifex online translation management tool.

Currently we are using the translations from upstream however once we will be sufficiently divergent from upstream we will set up suppocoin specific translation. In the meantime if you want to help, you can help with the translations in upstream and/or bitcoin.
